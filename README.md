## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am Tarunbir Singh Gambhir, a software engineer passionate about Artificial Intelligence. I believe AI holds the key to unraveling the mysteries of human psychology, helping us understand the intricate workings of our minds.

Beyond technology, I am profoundly interested in philosophy and the fundamental questions of life. The insights gained from philosophical inquiry guide my approach to both personal and professional endeavors.

### Favorite Philosophical Quotes
- "Dream is not that you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep." – Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam
- “The sign of thorough knowledge is the ability to teach.” – Aristotle
- “Good habits formed at youth make all the difference.” – Aristotle
- “All people by nature desire knowledge.” – Aristotle
- "I think, therefore I am." – René Descartes
- "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." – Socrates

My curiosity extends to the cosmos, where I am fascinated by deep space and the origins of the universe. I am driven by the quest to understand what lies outside our vision, secrets beyond the observable universe, and the secrets held within our minds.
